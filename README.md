# Dynamixel Respirator Open Source
This is the source code for the Dynamixel servo based setup.
The motor is controlled directly via an OpenCM 9.04 board (costs only ~10-15â‚¬).
Using a servo enables a closed loop design of the bag compression.

# Upload Code
Setup the development environment as described [here](http://emanual.robotis.com/docs/en/parts/controller/opencm904/#development-environment).
Connect the board to the computer via an USB port and open the main.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Click the upload button and a confirmation should note the success.
